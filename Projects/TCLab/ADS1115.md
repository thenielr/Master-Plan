We needed to work with an [[ADC]], because we want to get great resolution from the LM35. The ADS1115 works with 12 bits, this means that it has great resolution compared to the 8 bits form the ARDUINO. In the case of the ESP32 we don't have something like the 'AREF' from the ARDUINO. 

This device works with [[I2C bus]]
