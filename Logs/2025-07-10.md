Today I had to calibrate 8 pressure gauges, there were a problem two of them. All eight gauges had a range of (0 to 200) psi. The problem that I found was that for two of them there were an error of zero. By this I mean with zero psi the arrow was at 5psi so the value showed in the face of the gauge was wrong by 5 psi. A person I work with told me that I could do a 'Fatigue Test'. This, according to NOM-013, says that you have to take your pressure gauge to the max pressure it can manages, then wait some time and vent all that pressure. He explained that this test is made because the Bourdon Tube tends to 'stick' to the value the work regularly. But that test only worked with one gauge pressure. The other gauge pressure needed to be replaced because the error was outside the tolerance. 

The other part, I had to check a microplate washer by 'Well Wash', the problem with this instrument was that the extraction of the detergent wasn't enough  and there were some drops that affect the analysis. I solved it by cleaning the 'holes' with a needle a clean all those tubes. After some tests the microplate looked better and with almost no drops. 

Then, I had to check a Vaisala Temp and RH% with two channels. Because the transmitter blinked three times after it turned off. I was thinking that it was maybe because the polarity was wrong but since the are all connected to an 'Island' if I make a short, I can damage the power supply or the fuse. And since it's critic I had to change the transmitter for another Vaisala but different model. For this change I don't know how this gonna be done, I will watch tomorrow with a more experimented technician
